# Architectural Review and Improvement Proposals
- Current Tech Stack Overview:
  - Application: Symfony-based PHP API (PHP-FPM)
  - Database: AlloyDB (Managed PostgreSQL-compatible service on GCP)
  - Cache/Messaging: Redis
  - Messaging Queue: Google Cloud Pub/Sub
  - CI/CD: Bitbucket Pipelines
  - Container Orchestration: Kubernetes (GKE)
  - Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki

## Improvement Proposals
1. Scalability
   - Goal: Ensure the application can handle increasing load efficiently and automatically.
   - Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for PHP-FPM:
     - Proposal: Implement HPA based on CPU utilization, memory utilization, and potentially custom metrics (e.g., requests per second, PHP-FPM process count).
     - Benefit: Automatically scales PHP-FPM pods up or down based on real-time demand, optimizing resource usage and maintaining performance under varying loads.
   - Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) (Recommendation):
     - Proposal: Deploy VPA in recommendation mode initially to gather insights into optimal CPU and memory requests/limits for PHP-FPM pods. This helps prevent over-provisioning or under-provisioning.
     - Benefit: Provides data-driven recommendations for resource allocation, leading to more efficient node utilization and preventing resource-related performance bottlenecks.
   - Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler (GKE Feature):
     - Proposal: Ensure the GKE cluster has Cluster Autoscaler enabled and properly configured.
     - Benefit: Automatically adjusts the number of nodes in the node pools based on pending pods, ensuring that there's always enough underlying compute capacity for scaled-up applications.
   - Optimizing PHP-FPM Configuration:
     - Proposal: Tune PHP-FPM pm.max_children, pm.start_servers, pm.min_spare_servers, pm.max_spare_servers based on pod resource limits and typical request patterns. Consider ondemand process management for lower-traffic services.
     - Benefit: Maximizes the efficiency of each PHP-FPM pod, ensuring optimal concurrency and resource utilization per instance.
   - AlloyDB & Redis Scaling:
     - Proposal: Leverage the managed scaling capabilities of AlloyDB (read replicas, instance sizing) and Redis (clustering, instance sizing) as needed. Monitor connection pool usage from the application.
     - Benefit: Ensures database and cache layers can keep up with application demand without becoming bottlenecks.
2. Reliability
   - Goal: Increase the application's resilience to failures and ensure continuous availability.
   - Advanced Deployment Strategies (with Argo Rollouts):
     - Proposal: Move beyond basic rolling updates to Canary Deployments or Blue/Green Deployments using a tool like Argo Rollouts.
       - Canary: Gradually shift a small percentage of traffic to the new version, monitoring key metrics (error rates, latency) before promoting the new version fully.
       - Blue/Green: Deploy the new version alongside the old, then switch traffic instantly. Provides rapid rollback capability.
     - Benefit: Minimizes the blast radius of faulty deployments, allowing for safer and faster releases with automated verification and rollback.
   - Robust Liveness and Readiness Probes:
     - Proposal: Enhance existing probes:
       - Liveness Probe: Beyond just checking if PHP-FPM is running, implement a deeper check that verifies critical dependencies (e.g., database connection, Redis connection) are available. If this fails, Kubernetes restarts the pod.
       - Readiness Probe: Implement a check that verifies the application is fully initialized and ready to serve traffic (e.g., database migrations completed, cache warmed up). If this fails, Kubernetes temporarily removes the pod from the service endpoint, preventing traffic to an unhealthy instance.
     - Benefit: Prevents traffic from being routed to unhealthy or unready pods, improving user experience and system stability during deployments or transient failures.
   - Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs):
     - Proposal: Define PDBs for critical deployments.
     - Benefit: Ensures a minimum number of healthy pods are maintained during voluntary disruptions (e.g., node maintenance, cluster upgrades), preventing service outages.
   - Service Mesh (e.g., Istio or Linkerd) (Consideration):
     - Proposal: For complex microservice architectures, a service mesh can provide:
       - Traffic Management: Advanced routing, retries, circuit breakers.
       - Resilience Patterns: Automatic retries, timeouts, circuit breaking.
       - Observability: Built-in tracing, metrics, and logging for inter-service communication.
       - Security: Mutual TLS (mTLS) for all service-to-service communication.
     - Benefit: Enhances reliability by abstracting common resilience patterns and providing fine-grained control over traffic, though it adds operational overhead.
   - Automated Rollbacks:
     - Proposal: Integrate automated rollback logic into the CI/CD pipeline or GitOps controller. If post-deployment monitoring detects a significant spike in errors (e.g., 5xx rate exceeds a threshold), automatically trigger a rollback to the previous stable version.
     - Benefit: Drastically reduces MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery) by automating the response to bad deployments.
   - Disaster Recovery (DR) Strategy:
     - Proposal: For critical applications, consider a multi-region deployment strategy. This involves deploying the application and its dependencies across multiple GCP regions with data replication (e.g., AlloyDB cross-region replication, Redis replication, Pub/Sub global topics).
     - Benefit: Provides resilience against regional outages, ensuring business continuity.
3. Security
   - Goal: Protect the application and its data from unauthorized access and vulnerabilities.
   - Centralized Secrets Management & External Secrets Operator:
     - Proposal: Store all sensitive information (database credentials, API keys) in a dedicated secret manager like GCP Secret Manager. Use the External Secrets Operator in Kubernetes to sync these secrets into Kubernetes native Secret objects.
     - Benefit: Enhances security by separating secrets from code, providing auditing, versioning, and fine-grained access control for secrets. Prevents secrets from being committed to Git.
   - Kubernetes Network Policies:
     - Proposal: Implement strict Network Policies to control ingress and egress traffic between pods and namespaces. Follow the principle of least privilege. For example, only allow the PHP-FPM pods to connect to the AlloyDB and Redis services.
     - Benefit: Creates a secure network perimeter within the cluster, preventing unauthorized lateral movement.
   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Refinement:
     - Proposal: Review and refine Kubernetes RBAC roles and role bindings. Ensure users and service accounts only have the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks. Avoid cluster-admin roles for applications.
     - Benefit: Limits the potential damage from compromised credentials or misconfigurations.
   - Pod Security Standards (PSS) / Admission Controllers:
     - Proposal: Implement Pod Security Standards (e.g., restricted profile) or use an admission controller (like Gatekeeper or Kyverno) to enforce security best practices at the pod level (e.g., no privileged containers, no host path mounts, read-only root filesystems).
     - Benefit: Prevents common security vulnerabilities at the pod creation stage.
   - Container Image Scanning:
     - Proposal: Integrate automated container image scanning (e.g., using Google Container Analysis, Trivy, or Clair) into Bitbucket Pipelines. Scan images for known vulnerabilities before they are pushed to the registry.
     - Benefit: Identifies and addresses security vulnerabilities in base images and application dependencies early in the CI/CD pipeline.
   - Namespace Isolation:
     - Proposal: Use dedicated Kubernetes namespaces for different environments (e.g., dev, staging, production) and potentially for different applications or teams.
     - Benefit: Provides logical isolation for resources, simplifies RBAC, and prevents accidental cross-environment interference.
   - Service Account Least Privilege:
     - Proposal: Ensure each Kubernetes Deployment uses a dedicated Service Account with only the necessary permissions (e.g., for pulling images, accessing specific secrets).
     - Benefit: Reduces the attack surface if a pod is compromised.
4. Developer Velocity & CI/CD/GitOps Practices
   - Goal: Streamline the development workflow, automate deployments, and improve collaboration.
   - GitOps with ArgoCD:
     - Proposal: Adopt a GitOps workflow using ArgoCD. Git (Bitbucket) becomes the single source of truth for all Kubernetes configurations (Deployments, Services, Helm values, Network Policies). ArgoCD continuously monitors Git repositories and automatically syncs the cluster state to match the desired state defined in Git.
     - Benefit:
       - Automated Deployments: Eliminates manual kubectl apply commands.
       - Version Control: All infrastructure changes are versioned, auditable, and revertible.
       - Self-Healing: ArgoCD detects and corrects configuration drift.
       - Faster Rollbacks: Reverting a Git commit automatically triggers a rollback in the cluster.
       - Improved Collaboration: Developers can propose infrastructure changes via Pull Requests.
   - Standardized Helm Charts:
     - Proposal: Create and maintain standardized, reusable Helm charts for common application patterns (e.g., php-fpm-deployment, web-service). These charts should expose configurable values for app_name, image, env_vars, resources, etc.
     - Benefit: Promotes consistency, reduces boilerplate, and accelerates new service deployments.
   - Local Development Environment Enhancements:
     - Proposal: Provide developers with tools like Skaffold or Tilt to facilitate rapid inner-loop development. These tools can automatically build images, deploy to a local Kubernetes cluster (Minikube/Docker Desktop), and sync code changes without full CI/CD cycles.
     - Benefit: Significantly reduces the feedback loop for developers, allowing them to iterate faster on code changes in a Kubernetes-like environment.
   - Comprehensive Automated Testing in CI/CD:
     - Proposal: Ensure Bitbucket Pipelines include robust stages for:
       - Unit Tests: Fast, isolated tests for individual code units.
       - Integration Tests: Verify interactions between application components and dependencies (e.g., database, Redis).
       - Static Code Analysis: (As in Task 1) PHPStan, PHP_CodeSniffer.
       - Container Image Scanning: (As in Security section).
       - End-to-End (E2E) Tests: Automated tests that simulate user flows against a deployed environment.
     - Benefit: Catches bugs earlier in the development cycle, improves code quality, and provides confidence in deployments.
   - Pre-commit Hooks and Linters:
     - Proposal: Implement client-side pre-commit hooks (e.g., using Husky for Git) to run linters (PHP-CS-Fixer, PHP_CodeSniffer) and basic tests before code is committed.
     - Benefit: "Shifts left" quality checks, preventing common errors from even reaching the CI pipeline.
   - Self-Service Deployments (Controlled):
     - Proposal: Empower developers to trigger deployments to non-production environments (dev, staging) directly from Bitbucket or a GitOps dashboard (ArgoCD UI), within defined guardrails.
     - Benefit: Reduces bottlenecks by giving developers more control over their release cycles, while maintaining governance.
